## Whois Lookup
- Author: [William Weir](https://github.com/TheSirLancelot)
- Description: Whois is a widely used Internet record listing that identifies who owns a domain and how to get in contact with them. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain name registration and ownership. Whois records have proven to be extremely useful and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the integrity of the domain name registration and website ownership process. A Whois record contains all of the contact information associated with the person, group, or company that registers a particular domain name. Typically, each Whois record will contain information such as the name and contact information of the Registrant (who owns the domain), the name and contact information of the Registrar (the organization or commercial entity that registered the domain name), the registration dates, the name servers, the most recent update, and the expiration date. Whois records may also provide the administrative and technical contact information (which is often, but not always, the registrant).
- Usage:
    1. From the Netulla home page, click the Whois Lookup Tool link in the sidebar.
    2. Enter the IP address or domain name you would like to get the whois information for and hit `Enter`.
    3. Your results should be displayed if you entered a legitimate IP address. If the domain you entered has whois information, it will be displayed. If no whois information can be found for your domain, a blank whois entry will be displayed.
    4. To receive information for additional IP addresses or domains, simply erase your previous entry and type a new one, then hit `Enter`.
